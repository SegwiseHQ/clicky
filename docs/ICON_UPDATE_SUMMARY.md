## Implementation Details

The changes were made in the `SIMPLE_ICONS` dictionary in `config.py`:

```python
SIMPLE_ICONS = {
    # Updated icons

    "ICON_SAVE": "[S]",        # was "[SAVE]"
    "ICON_LOAD": "[L]",        # was "[LOAD]"
    "ICON_CONNECT": "[C]",     # was "[CONNECT]"
    "ICON_DISCONNECT": "[D]",  # was "[DISC]"
    
    # Unchanged icons
    "ICON_DATABASE": "[DB]",
    "ICON_TABLE": "[T]",
    # ... other icons remain the same
}
```

## Testing Status
