# ClickHouse Client Application - Final Project Status

## ✅ ALL MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED

### 🎯 Primary Issue Fixed: UI Status Indicators
**Problem:** Status box showed "not connected" despite successful connection, and left panel showed "Connect to see tables" even when connection was working.

**Root Cause:** 
- `refresh_tables()` method was overwriting successful connection status messages
- UI initialization timing issue caused status updates to be lost
- Theme binding errors in modal contexts

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Removed status callback overwrite in `refresh_tables()` method
- ✅ Fixed UI initialization timing by moving `auto_load_and_connect()` after UI setup
- ✅ Added safe theme binding to prevent DearPyGUI exceptions
- ✅ Updated credentials to point to working ClickHouse cloud instance

### 🏗️ Project Organization Complete
**Completed:** Professional project structure with proper separation of concerns
